# Linux-Mint-Light (Work in Progress)

This is a desktop theme for the Cinnamon (3.4.6) desktop environment. It's a light version of the Linux Mint theme which complements the Mint-X family of Cinnamon Controls and Window Border themes, and more resembles the Xfce and MATE panels with the Mint-X themes made for those editions.

So far, only edits to the panel have been made in cinnamon.css. When it's complete, it will be pull requested into https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-themes. 


## Installation

Download and extract (or clone) the Linux-Mint-Light folder into ~/.themes.

Change Cinnamon desktop themes in System Settings -> Appearance -> Themes.
